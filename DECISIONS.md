# DECISIONS.md

I renamed the functions and added short docstrings so it’s clear what each part does. 
I used list comprehensions to replace the longer for-loops because they make the code shorter and easier to read. 
I also added small inline comments to explain the logic in simple words. 
The program still works the same but now looks cleaner and follows Python’s style rules.
